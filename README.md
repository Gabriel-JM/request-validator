# request-validator
A simple request validator in JS.

## How to use?
It's very simple, you just need an `object` that represents the `model` to be compared, than instantiate the `RequestValidator` Object and pass the model as parameter, and finally pass the `request object` to the validate method of the RequestValidator.

### Plus than the usual
I'm adding tests to the project, i created this validator to my `my-ts-node-api` project and i thinked "i can use this to train my tests", and i did it.
